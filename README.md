## Code branches
The repository is maintained to keep dependency versions up-to-date. 
This requires efforts and time to test all the examples on new versions, so, be patient.

The logic is following: there are several branches of the code, corresponding to 
major pytorch version code was tested. Due to incompatibilities in pytorch and other components,
**code in the printed book might differ from the code in the repo**.

At the moment, there are the following branches available:
* `master`: contains the code with the latest pytorch which was tested. At the moment, it is pytorch 1.3.
* `torch-1.3-book`: code printed in the book with minor bug fixes. Uses pytorch=1.3 which 
is available only on conda repos.
* `torch-1.7`: pytorch 1.7. This branch is still under testing.  

All the branches uses python 3.7, more recent versions weren't tested.
